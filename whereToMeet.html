        <h2>Where to meet</h2>

        <p>We don't have an office location which is accessible for the public.<br><br>But face-to-face contact is
            important. To meet someone in real life and have a conversation. Emotions matter. Feeling being real and
            taken seriously matters.<br>So additional to our online consultation we also real life meeting ups.</p>
        <p>We know several public accessible and safe environments to meet. Safety is important and a casual environment
            can ease the tension. We don't want to have a clinical environment. For mental issues we need comfortable
            spaces.</p>
        <p>We discuss possible locations on an individual basis but often preferred locations are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Malls</li>
            <li>Cafes</li>
            <li>At a park</li>
            <li>At locations which are known and comfortable to the person in distress</li>
        </ul>
