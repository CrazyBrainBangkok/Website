        <p>Someone often develops a mental disorder early on life due to many factors.<br>WeÂ commonly see those disorder
            in our visitors</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adjustment disorder</li>
            <li>Bipolar (manic depressive)</li>
            <li>Depression</li>
            <li>Dysthymia</li>
            <li>Borderline</li>
            <li>Anxiety</li>
            <li>PTSD/C-PTSD</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If psychiatrists have been visited in the past they often misdiagnose or don't take the person in distress
            serious. Often appointments take too long to get.<br>Or the doctor doesn't explain the process on how they
            plan to treat the disorder.</p>
        <p>Our visitors often already experienced suicide attempts and often it is just a matter of time until they are
            successful. Most of the times there is no hope to be healed forever. But we can help learning to live with
            it.</p>
        <p>We offer those individual coaching topics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identifying, discussing and confirming the existing disorder(s). Helping you to understand the diagnosis
                from your previous doctors.</li>
            <li>Explaining the medication strategy of psychiatrists and warning about common issues and dangers of it
            </li>
            <li>Showing a toolset of techniques on how to handle sudden mental distress</li>
            <li>Help you to receiving public healthcare in Bangkok in case you come from outside Bangkok</li>
            <li>Showing you existing communities of people your age who are trying to cope in healthy and unhealthy ways
            </li>
        </ul>
