        <p>A visit at a psychiatrist is important and can't be replaced. They are specialized on mental health and also
            can legally prescribe strong medication.</p>

        <p>Common issues with receiving treatment from a psychiatrist are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Hard to receive an appointment quickly enough</li>
            <li>Services are too expensive</li>
            <li>In case of public hospitals they don't have enough time</li>
            <li>They don't explain enough</li>
            <li>They don't talk about the long term treatment plan</li>
            <li>Receiving the wrong diagnosis</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You maybe already experienced suicide attempts and often it is just a matter of time until it takes a sad
            ending. Most of the times there is no hope to be healed forever. But we can help learning to live with a
            mental illness.
