        <h2>About us</h2>

        <p>We are Bangkok based network from volunteers who offer mental health consultation.</p>

        <p>We currently don't have an office and provide our services on safe spaces which are also convenient for the
        person in distress.</p>

        <p>Because conventional psychiatrists and psychologists are either cannot be afforded or the waiting lists are too
        long.</p>

        <p>We currently only offer english consultation services but very soon offer our services in Thai Language
        aswell.</p>


        <h2>The Founder</h2>
        <p><img id="robert-image" class="centered-img" src="./img/Robert.jpg" alt="The founder Robert Ernst"></p>
        <p><strong>Robert Ernst</strong>: I am since 8 years in Bangkok and saw many young people struggle
            with mental illnesses. I am unhappy how expensive and hard the access to useful healthcare is. With
            CrazyBrainBangkok we offer supportive mental healthcare for free on a NGO basis. We sadly don't have the
            same legal status as a clinic but this enables us to go a way which is maybe more helpful for those in
            distress.</p>
        <p>If you contact us via Line there is a good change that you will be talking with me. We plan to extend our
            services offered in Thai Language aswell. Currently we are looking for the right people to extend our staff.</p>
        <p>We currently don't provide a physical location but planning in doing so when we secured a sufficient amount
            of founding. We want to be reachable for people and thus a location near to MRT/BTS will be necessary, which
            makes this endeavor harder.</p>
