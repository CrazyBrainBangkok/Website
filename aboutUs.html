        <h2>About us</h2>

        <p>We are a Bangkok based non-profit organization which offers mental health consultation.</p>

        <p>We currently don't have an office.</p>

        <p>We currently only offer english consultation services but very soon offer our services in Thai Language
            aswell.</p>


        <h2>The Founder</h2>
        <p><img id="robert-image" class="centered-img" src="./img/Robert.jpg" alt="The founder Robert Ernst"></p>
        <p><strong>Robert Ernst</strong>: I am since 8 years in Bangkok and saw many young people struggle
            with mental illnesses. I am unhappy how expensive and hard the access to helping healthcare is. With
            CrazyBrainBangkok I want to offer supportive mental healthcare for FREE on a NGO basis. We sadly don't have
            the same legal status as a clinic but this enables us to go a way which is maybe more helpful for those in
            need of help.</p>
        <p>If you contact us via Line there is a good change that you will be talking with me. We plan to extend our
            services offered in Thai Language aswell. Currently we are looking for the right people to extend our staff
            and volunteers.
        </p>
        <p>We currently don't have an office but planning in doing so when we secured a sufficient amount
            of founding. However we want to be reachable for people and thus a location near to MRT/BTS will be necessary.</p>
