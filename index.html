        kind of advice. This can be via Line or in some cases meeting in real life. This is for all the urgent cases
        in which regular doctors aren't available for whatever reason.

        How to survive mental illnesses is a consultation which helps you to understand what mental illness you
        have and how to live with it step by step to get it under control. This applies especially in receiving techniques in
